Peer Review: The calculator follows the given design pretty well, website had a good mobile layout, calculations appear instant and accurate, it even detects when I put an invalid value. However there are some issues (I'll leave potential solutions in paranthesis like this). The buttons don't remain cyan after clicking on them (Add and remove classes), the reset button only resets the variables which leave the fields filled in (Change values to be empty), and mobile layout comes a little too late (Change to bigger breakpoint). If we were to go deeper then I'd really like the ring to be cyan as well rather than just blue, and the fonts on the buttons could be bolder.
